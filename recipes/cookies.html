      <p>These cookies were voted an all-time favorite in our family. They can be made any time of the year-bring them to parties, keep them for your family, save one for yourself, save 10 for yourself, whatever you want! I promise everyone will love this delicious balance of sweet but not too sweet. Eat hot, eat cold, eat these whenever. They can be stored in the freezer or in a container.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <h3>Cookies:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</l> 
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 cup mashed ripe banana</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup margarine</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts (Optional)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Frosting:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup milk, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups powdered sugar, or to taste</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Stir baking soda into sour cream in a separate large bowl; add mashed banana and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Cream margarine and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Beat in eggs. Mix in banana-sour cream mixture until incorporated. Add dry ingredients until well combined. Stir in nuts.</li>
        <li>Drop small spoonfuls of batter onto the prepared cookie sheet; cookies do not expand much in the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, checking occasionally, until bottoms are light golden brown and cookies are set but still a tad soft, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove cookies to a rack to cool.</li>
        <li>While the cookies are cooling, prepare frosting: Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in brown sugar and reduce heat to low. Stir and bring to a boil. Boil, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Remove from heat. </li>
        <li>Stir in 1/4 cup milk and bring to a boil again. Remove from heat and let cool, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gradually stir in powdered sugar until frosting is desired consistency. If frosting hardens while working, stir in a little bit of milk.</li>
        <li>Spread frosting on cooled cookies.</li>
      </ol>
