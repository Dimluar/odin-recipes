      <h1>Grandma's Banana Pudding</h1>
      <img src="../images/pudding.jpg" alt="Four desserts on a cup" width="480">

      <p>My grandma's old-fashioned banana pudding recipe was always something she made from memory, but I let her talk it out so I could write it down. She ran a country club and restaurant in her day; she can make amazing food, but she doesn't measure anything and makes most foods from memory.</p>
      <p class="params">Prep Time: 25 mins | Cook Time: 35 mins | Servings: 8</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <h3>Pudding:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, separated, divided</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package vanilla wafers, divided</li>
        <li>4 medium bananas, sliced, or more to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Meringue:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Make the pudding: Combine sugar, flour, and salt in a bowl. Set egg whites aside for meringue.</li>
        <li>Beat egg yolks in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar mixture alternately with milk and vanilla, stirring constantly. Bring to a simmer and cook until slightly thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Add butter; continue stirring until thickened to a pudding-like consistency, 5 to 7 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Line the bottom of a baking dish with 1/2 of the wafers. Layer 1/2 of the banana slices over wafers and cover with 1/2 of the pudding. Repeat layers once more.</li>
        <li>Make the meringue: Beat reserved egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl, gradually adding cream of tartar, until soft peaks form. Add sugar and continue beating on high speed until stiff peaks form. Fold in vanilla. Spoon meringue over pudding.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until meringue browns, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool before serving.</li>
      </ol>
