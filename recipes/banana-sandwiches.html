    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>200g peanut butter</li>
      <li>175g golden caster sugar</li>
      <li>75g chopped dark chocolate</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the ice cream:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 peeled chopped frozen bananas</li>
      <li>2 tbsp double cream</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla essence</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4 and line two large baking sheets with
        baking parchment. Put the peanut butter, sugar, Â¼ tsp fine table salt
        and chocolate chunks in a bowl and mix well with a wooden spoon. Crack
        in the egg and mix again until the mixture clumps together and forms a
        dough
      </li>
      <li>
        Break off chunks of dough (about the size of a cherry tomato) and
        arrange them, spaced apart, on the sheets. Press the cookies down with
        the back of a fork to squash them a little. (The cookies can be frozen
        for up to two months - to cook from frozen, add an extra 1-2 mins to the
        cooking time.) Bake for about 12 mins until golden around the edges and
        paler in the centre. Leave to cool on the trays for 5 mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, put the bananas, cream and vanilla in a food processor and
        blend until they make a thick ice cream. Scoop into balls with an ice
        cream scoop, and sandwich between the cookies. Serve immediately.
